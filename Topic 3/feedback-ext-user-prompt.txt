If the student used a collection comprehension or iterator comprehension expression in their solution, tell them that such expressions will be covered in Topic 9 and suggest them to try to solve the problem using only the notions they studied so far to better achieve the learning outcomes of the module. Give a hint on how to solve the problem without such an expression. In your suggestions for improvement, do not mention such expressions.
